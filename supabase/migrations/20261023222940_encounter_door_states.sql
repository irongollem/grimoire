-- Migration: encounter_door_states
-- Doors open and close during play on the battle map (#1073 follow-up).
--
-- A published Drawing carries its doors in the live snapshot (`locations.map_live.doors`, `{ edge, open }` in image
-- cells) at the state they were drawn in, and light and sight have stopped at the closed ones since story 6. Whether a
-- door stands open during a fight is play state, and like magical darkness (story 10) it belongs to the fight, not to
-- the drawing: `door_states` is a list of overrides `{ edge, open }`, one per door the DM has opened or shut, over the
-- drawn state. A door not named keeps its drawn state. Every go-live starts it empty, so each fight opens on the map as
-- drawn.
--
-- The DM writes it with the rest of the live state (the runner's debounced update); players read it through
-- `get_player_encounter_state`, which returns a table, so it is dropped and created again with the column appended.
-- Which doors stand open is not a secret: the leaf is drawn open or shut for everyone at the table.

-- A check constraint cannot hold a subquery, so the shape test is a function. Total (true or false, never NULL):
-- anything that is not a list of well-formed overrides is false. An edge key is `"x,y:N"` or `"x,y:W"`.
